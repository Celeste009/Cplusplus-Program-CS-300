In this project, I addressed the challenge of efficiently managing course data by implementing various data structures, including Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, and Vectors. My approach involved a careful analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure to effectively load, validate, and retrieve course information. When faced with challenges such as prerequisite validation and optimizing data retrieval, I overcame them by selecting the most appropriate data structure based on runtime complexity and performance needs. This experience has enhanced my approach to software design by underscoring the critical importance of choosing the right data structures to create programs that are not only efficient but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future requirements.
